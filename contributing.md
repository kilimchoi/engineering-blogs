# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- One pull request per add.
- The pull request and commit message should include what was added/removed.
- Please squash related commits for each pull request you submit.
- Use the following format: `Name link` e.g. Airbnb http://nerds.airbnb.com/
- For company blogs, make sure that 80% of content is technical (posts about interesting technical challenges, lessons they've learned, etc). No PR, self-promoting posts.
- For individual blogs, as long as posts are mostly technical (not as strict with the ratio as the company one), I am happy to add them.
- After making changes to the README, run `bundle install` to install the dependencies and then the opml generation script (`./generate_opml.rb`) to update the opml file.
